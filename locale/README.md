# FactorioUtils
My softmod utilities for factorio

## Instructions
Include this repo inside a folder named "locale". This is the only folder that can be included in a scenario.

## Note
This is meant to be used with my own scenarios. It's hacky but convenient for myself.

## Credit

RSO is not my own creation. It was done by Orzelek. I requested permission to include it in my scenario.

Several other portions of the code (tags, frontier style rocket silo) have also been adapted from other scenario code.
